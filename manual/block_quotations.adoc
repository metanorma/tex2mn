= Block quotations

NOTE: These features are verified by tests in {repo-blob-url}/test/test_block_quotations.rb[test_block_quotations.rb].

You can typeset block quotations using the `quote` environment:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|[source,latex]
----
\begin{quote}
  This is a block quotation.
\end{quote}
----
|
[source,asciidoc]
----
  [quote]
  ____
  This is a block quotation.
  ____
----
|===

The attribution and the citation title can be passed through to AsciiDoc by using the `*\mn*` macro:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|[source,latex]
----
\begin{quote}
  \mn{ISO,"ISO7301, section 1"}
  This is a block quotation.
\end{quote}
----
|
[source,asciidoc]
----
  [quote,ISO,"ISO7301, section 1"]
  ____
  This is a block quotation.
  ____
----
|===

CAUTION: This feature is not complete; attribution and citation title are currently not rendered by `LaTeX`.
