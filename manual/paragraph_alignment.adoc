= Paragraph alignment

NOTE: These features are verified by tests in {repo-blob-url}/test/test_paragraph_alignment.rb[test_paragraph_alignment.rb].

You can set paragraph alignment explicitly using the `flushleft`, `center` and `flushright` environments.

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|[source,latex]
----
\begin{flushleft}
  This paragraph is left aligned.
\end{flushleft}
----
|[source,asciidoc]
----
[align=left]
This paragraph is left aligned.
----
|===

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|[source,latex]
----
\begin{center}
  This paragraph is centered.
\end{center}
----
|[source,asciidoc]
----
[align=center]
This paragraph is centered.
----
|===

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|[source,latex]
----
\begin{flushright}
  This paragraph is right aligned.
\end{flushright}
----
|[source,asciidoc]
----
[align=right]
This paragraph is right aligned.
----
|===

The default alignment is _justified_, so no environment is provided for that.
