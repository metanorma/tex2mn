= Symbols and abbreviations

`Symbols and Abbreviations` sections are expected to be simple <<_description_lists,description lists>>.

Metanorma takes care of sorting the symbol entries in the order prescribed by ISO/IEC DIR 2, but it does not support sorting LaTeX math entries.
Also note that the PDF rendered directly by LaTeX will not be sorted.
