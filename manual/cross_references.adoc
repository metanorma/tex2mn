= Cross-references (aka internal references)

[NOTE]

These features are verified by tests in {repo-blob-url}/test/test_cross_references.rb[test_cross_references.rb].

To reference some part of the document you must first of all label it using `\label`.
Many parts of the document accept labels (headings, tables, list items, etc.) and you will find an example in the related section when that's the case.

For the sake of the next examples, let's assume a section labeled `sec:foo` exists.

You can reference `sec:foo` by using the `\ref` macro:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|[source,latex]
Go look at \ref{sec:foo}.
|[source,asciidoc]
Go look at <<sec:foo>>.
|===

To reference `sec:foo` with a custom text you can use the `\hyperref` macro:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|[source,latex]
Go look at \hyperref[sec:foo]{this}.
|[source,asciidoc]
Go look at <<sec:foo, this>>.
|===
