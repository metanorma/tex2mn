= Todos

[NOTE]
====
These features are verified by tests in {repo-blob-url}/test/test_todos.rb[test_todos.rb].
====

You can typeset todo notes by using the `*todo*` environment.

By using `*\mn*` at the beginning of the environment you can set the following attributes:

`reviewer` (_optional_)::
Name of the reviewer
`from` (_optional_)::
Starting target anchor
`to` (_optional_)::
Ending target anchor
`date` (_optional_)::
Date attribute (optionally including time)

Here is a full example:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|[source,latex]
\begin{todo}
  \mn{reviewer="John Doe",date=20180125T0121,from=A,to=B}
  Lorem ipsum.
\end{todo}
|[source,asciidoc]
----
[TODO,reviewer="John Doe",date=20180125T0121,from=A,to=B]
====
Lorem ipsum.

|===

CAUTION: The `reviewer` and `date` attributes are currently not rendered by LaTeX but only passed to Adoc.
