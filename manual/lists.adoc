= Lists

All usual typologies of lists available in `LaTeX` can be used;
as usual, they work by listing items usinf the `\item` macro inside a specific environment.

== Ordered lists

NOTE: These features are verified by tests in {repo-blob-url}/test/test_ordered_lists.rb[test_ordered_lists.rb].

You can typeset ordered lists using the `enumerate` environment:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|[source,latex]
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Hey,
  \item ho,
  \item let's go!
\end{enumerate}
|[source,asciidoc]
. Hey,
. ho,
. letâ€™s go!
|===

== Unordered lists

NOTE: These features are verified by tests in {repo-blob-url}/test/test_unordered_lists.rb[test_unordered_lists.rb].

You can typeset unordered lists using the `itemize` environment:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|[source,latex]
\begin{itemize}
  \item Foo
  \item Bar
  \item Baz
\end{itemize}
|[source,asciidoc]
* Foo
* Bar
* Baz
|===

== Description lists

NOTE: These features are verified by tests in {repo-blob-url}/test/test_description_lists.rb[test_description_lists.rb].

You can typeset description lists using the `description` environment:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|[source,latex]
\begin{description}
  \item[Lee] bass guitar and lead vocals
  \item[Lifeson] guitars and backing vocals
  \item[Peart] drums and percussion
\end{description}
|[source,asciidoc]
Lee:: bass guitar and lead vocals
Lifeson:: guitars and backing vocals
Peart:: drums and percussion
|===




== Nested lists

NOTE: These features are verified by tests in {repo-blob-url}/test/test_stressed_lists.rb[test_stressed_lists.rb].

You can nest ordered, unordered and description lists freely.

CAUTION: While `AsciiDoc` has no depth limit, `LaTeX` is limited to a depth of 4.
